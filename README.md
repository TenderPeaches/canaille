# README

A web app that seeks to link up people who need some kind of services with people who can provide them. 

For someone seeking services, their options are two-fold: they can create a public service request which service providers can quote them for or they can browse service providers that offer the given service and contact them directly. 

For someone - or a business - offering services, their options mirror the clients'. They can browse public service requests to offer individual quotes or they can offer a list of services with baked-in prices for the clients' to browse. 

The goal is to help bridge the gap between customers and businesses without defining how transactions are concluded, leaving it up to the involved parties. This removes the application from having to implement transactional features and to prevent liability in case of payment disputes, as the transactions occur directly between the clients and the service providers.
